The code in this repository collates the responses from a quiz. At the end of each quiz session, the user gets the opportunity to add a name which is saved against his quiz score. These are collated as highscores. A live demo can be found [here](https://emman77240.github.io/Web-Api-Challenge/).

## Description
In this repository, quiz questions are dynamically added to a HTML page. After a user completes the quiz, his scores are recorded against his name which he is given the opportunity to add. The quiz is timed and when the user fails a question, 10 seconds are removed from the remaining time as penalty. The quiz can be started by clicking the "Start Quiz" button.
